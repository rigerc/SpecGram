# SpecGram

SDD Kit for Kilocode


SpecGram is an open-source project focused enabling Spec-Driven Development
(SDD) directly in Kilocode without the need for external tools or modes. This
doesn't prevent the use of external tools, but it does mean that you can work
entirely within Kilocode if you want to.

SpecGram is inspired by and pulls heavily from
[Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) and
[BMAD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) (both under MIT License).

A Kilo is made up of thousands from Grams. It's just a Spec. ðŸ˜Š

## Give it a try

Copy the `.roo` directory into your project. `.roomodes` is 100% optional. It installs modes that are available from the Kilocode marketplace. They are not used by any of the core `/specify`, `/plan`, or `/tasks` workflows but can be helpful during implementation.
